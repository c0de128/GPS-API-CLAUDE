## **1. Overview**
### **Project Name:** GPS Trip Tracker (MVP)
### **Objective:**
Build a **mobile-first web application** that allows users to track their GPS location in real-time, log trip information (including speed), replay routes, and access historical trip data. **No user authentication or third-party integrations** are required for this phase.

## **2. Features & Requirements**

### **A. Landing Page**
- **Description:** A simple, mobile-friendly landing page introducing the app and its features.
- **Requirements:**
  - App name and brief description
  - "Start Tracking" button (directly opens the tracking page)
  - Minimalist design, optimized for mobile

---

### **B. GPS Tracking**
- **Description:** Real-time GPS location and speed tracking.
- **Requirements:**
  - Start/Stop tracking button (prominent on mobile)
  - Real-time map display of the user’s location and route (using Mapbox or Google Maps API)
  - **Speed tracking:** Display current speed (mph/kmh) during the trip
  - Background location updates (if supported by the browser)
  - Battery optimization for mobile devices

---

### **C. Trip Management**
- **Description:** Users can create, view, and manage trip information.
- **Requirements:**
  - **Trip Details:**
    - Trip name
    - Start/End location (auto-filled from GPS or manual entry)
    - Waypoints (auto-logged or manual)
    - Start/End time (auto-filled)
    - **Average speed and max speed** (calculated)
    - Distance traveled (calculated)
    - Notes/description
  - **Trip List View:**
    - Simple list or card view of all trips
    - Filter/sort by date or name
    - Search functionality (optional for MVP)

---

### **D. Route Replay**
- **Description:** Users can replay their trip route on the map.
- **Requirements:**
  - Play/Pause/Stop controls for route replay
  - Adjustable replay speed
  - Visual indicator of current position during replay
  - Display speed and timestamp during replay

---

### **E. Data Storage**
- **Description:** Store trip data locally (browser storage) for now.
- **Requirements:**
  - Use **localStorage** or **IndexedDB** to save trip data
  - No backend/database required for MVP
  - Data persists between sessions

---

### **F. Data Export**
- **Description:** Provide a simple way to export trip data.
- **Requirements:**
  - Button to export trip data as a JSON file
  - Include all trip details (route, speed, waypoints, etc.)

---

## **3. Technical Stack**
- **Frontend:** React.js or Vue.js (mobile-first, responsive design)
- **Maps:** Mapbox GL JS or Google Maps JavaScript API
- **Storage:** localStorage/IndexedDB (no backend)
- **Hosting:** Static site hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)

---

## **4. User Flow**
1. User visits the landing page and clicks "Start Tracking."
2. The app requests GPS permission and starts logging the trip (location and speed).
3. The user can add/edit trip details (name, waypoints, notes).
4. User stops tracking; the trip is saved to local storage.
5. User can view past trips, replay routes, or export trip data as JSON.

---

## **5. Success Metrics**
- **Functionality:** GPS and speed tracking accuracy, route replay smoothness.
- **Usability:** Ease of use on mobile devices, intuitive controls.
- **Data Persistence:** Trip data (including speed and route) saved correctly between sessions.
